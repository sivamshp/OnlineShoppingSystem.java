# OnlineShoppingSystem.java

This program allows customers to select products by entering the corresponding product number. The selected products will be added to the customer's cart, and they can view their cart contents and the total price of the items. The list of available products is initialized with a few sample products, but you can extend it by adding more products to the initializeProducts() method if you wish.
